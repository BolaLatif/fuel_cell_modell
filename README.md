# fuel_cell_modell
This project involved developing a predictive model for a turbo fuel cell using collected data.
The goal was to create a model capable of accurately predicting performance metrics. For this, we applied regression techniques and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to analyze the data and build a model.
The approach aimed to optimize predictive accuracy and understand the relationships between various parameters affecting the fuel cell's performance.
